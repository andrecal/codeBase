# Partical Accelerator Model.

The intention of this project is to build a model of a particle accelerator. I will create an accelerator that will move a tiny steel ball on a circular track. The problem is to initiate the movement of the steel ball so that the movement is continuous, until it is stopped.

Materials:
•	Enamelled Copper wire
•	Copper tape
•	Alligator clips
•	Resistors
•	Transistors 
•	Clear tubing
•	24” x 24” Plywood (1/4”, ½”, ¾” pieces)
•	Steel ball
•	Batteries
•	Capacitors
